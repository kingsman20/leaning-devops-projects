# Introduction to Linux and basic commands 

Linux is a family of open-source Unix operating system based on the Linux Kernel. As well include Red Hat,Debian,openSUSE,Fedora,and Ubuntu.

## What is Linux command?

A linux command is a program or utility that runs on the CLI- a console that interacts with the system via texts and processes. It's similar to the Command Promt application in Windows and the Terminal application in Mac.

Linux commands are executed on Terminal by pressing Enter at the end of the line. The commands perform various tasks. They are case sensitive, and are of three parts; CommandName(the rule that you want to perform), Option or Flag(modifies a commands operations and invoked by hypens"-"or double hypens "--") and Parameter or argument(specifies any necessary information for the command).
